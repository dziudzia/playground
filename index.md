### From Log Events to Process Indicators

The International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), together with the Leibniz Institute for Research and Information in Education (DIPF) and the Centre for International Student Assessment (ZIB), hosted a three-day workshop on analyzing log file and process data from large-scale international assessments in education. The event took place as an interactive webinar and online video conference on June 17th - 19th, 2020.

The workshop was the second event of a growing community dealing with process data from large-scale assessments, after a [first process data conference and workshop in Dublin](http://www.erc.ie/2019/03/15/process-data-conference-and-workshop-dublin-may-2019/) in May 2019 hosted by Educational Research Centre (Dublin, Ireland; ERC) and Educational Testing Service (Princeton, NJ, USA; ETS). 

The [first two days](frankfurt2020/) of the workshop in 2020 focused on managing, preparing, analyzing, and sharing insights from process data. On the third day, the focus was on practical, hands-on training using log-file data from the most recent cycle of the IEAâ€™s Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, TIMSS 2019.

Since the number of places for the workshop was limited, recorded sessions and slides are provided on [this page](frankfurt2020/).
